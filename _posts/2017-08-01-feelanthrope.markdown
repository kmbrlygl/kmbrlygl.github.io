## Role

Logo design

## Background

Feelanthrope offers digital marketing services and is based in San Diego, CA. Ally Celones, the founder of Feelanthrope, reached out to me to create a logo that capture the traits she wanted her brand to convey: 

> authentic, caring, smart, adaptable, adventurous

## Mood Board

The client wanted to incorporate vibrant colors and triangular shapes to achieve a mark that's reflective of her brand and aesthetic.
