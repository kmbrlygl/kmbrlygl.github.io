# Role
Print design, visual design, art direction

# Background
One Bella Casa (OBC) is an online home decor company established in 2013 that specializes in textile products, such as throw pillows, duvet covers, tote bags, and shower curtains.

# Challenge
Before I came to OBC, we did not had a comprehensive catalog to show clients, although there were sales sheets and small brochures put together for meetings. Since this was essentially new, I had the freedom to establish the workflow and organization of how to tackle the project.

# Process
At the time, Adobe InDesign was not my forté, but I knew it would be the best program for such a publication. I had to figure it all out on my own and familiarize myself with ways to gather all the images and SKUs efficiently, using Excel and InDesign together. I spent 2-3 months developing each catalog, learning from them, and improving it each time.

From 2014-2015, I designed the overall look and feel of OBC’s quarterly print catalogs. It not only involved the design of each spread, but I also assisted in the art direction for product photoshoots, produced lifestyle mockups, and designed some of the patterns and graphics on the products themselves.

I experimented with differing arrangements of photographs and text to create visual interest and rhythm.
