# Role
Print design, visual design, art direction

# Background
One Bella Casa (OBC) is an online home decor company established in 2013 that specializes in textile products, such as throw pillows, duvet covers, tote bags, and shower curtains.

# Challenge
When I joined the team at OBC, I was tasked with creating sales sheets for CEO's meetings with different buyers across the country. After some time creating a separate new sales sheet for each meeting, we began to realize the need for a comprehensive catalog to show our prospective clients without the overhead cost of having starting from scratch. This was a new project that was never done at the company before, so I took on the task of establishing the workflow and organization of how to tackle this project.

# Process
At the time, Adobe InDesign was not my forté, but I knew it would be the best program for such a publication. I had to figure out how to use it and familiarize myself with ways to gather all the images and SKUs efficiently, using Excel and InDesign together. I broke down the tasks, set deadlines and put together a plan and timeline to get it done. I spent about 2-3 months developing each catalog, learning from them, and improving it each time.

So from 2014-2015, I designed the overall look and feel of OBC’s quarterly print catalogs. It not only involved the design of each spread, but I also assisted in the art direction for product photoshoots, produced lifestyle mockups, and designed some of the patterns and graphics on the products themselves.

I really enjoyed the learning process behind using new software, learning new skills, and being part of every aspect that goes into putting together a successful catalog.
