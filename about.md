## Visual designer – <br> Lettering hobbyist – <br> Former Navy brat –

<a href="/assets/klosenara-2018-resume.pdf">Résumé</a>

Kimberly Gail is a visual designer looking to find her niche in the design world. She's interested in all facets of design—from lettering, typography, layouts, user research—anything and everything pushing the boundaries of her capabilities or influencing change for the better.

Growing up as a Navy brat, she attributes 'home' to more than once place. She was born with the travel bug, and has yet to shake it off. Ask her about all the wonderful places she grew up in and where she's been! 

[//]:On the right, she sits (with terrible posture) pensively gazing into the English countryside.

Off duty, she's either rushing off to catch a live show, dropping the sickest beets at her local farmer's market (see photo), practicing her French, <s>lifting weights</s> eating dollar tacos at Jalapeño&rsquo;s on Tuesdays, concocting a pitcher of sangria, or catching up on her favorite TV shows.

Thanks for reading!
