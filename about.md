## Visual designer – <br> Aspiring letterer – <br> Former Navy brat –

<a href="/assets/klosenara-2016-resume.pdf">Resumé</a>

Kimberly Gail is a visual designer looking to find her niche in the design world. She's interested in all facets of design, from lettering, typography, layouts, user research—really though, anything and everything pushing the boundaries or influencing change for the better. She believes in thoughtful and meaningful design solutions, and collaboration as means to get there.

She's currently based [and loves living] in Sacramento, CA. <br>
As a former Navy brat, she grew up in the Philippines, Japan, Texas, and Nevada.
I guess she was just born with the travel bug. <br>
On the right, she's sitting with terrible posture, looking all pensive and shit in Yorkshire, England in 2014.

Off duty, she's either rushing off to catch a live show, practicing hand lettering, exploring the Midtown farmer's market, scarfing down Viet, Laos or Thai food, trying to recreate said foods at home, workin' on her fitness, tinkering around with HTML and CSS, or... maybe really just catching up her favorite TV shows (ahem, Doctor Who). 

She also specializes in baking delicious chocolate banana nut bread and concocting an awesome pitcher of homemade sangria. Mmm.
