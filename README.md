# Design Portfolio on Jekyll

Hey there! Thanks for taking a peek at [my portfolio site](https://kmbrlygl.github.io/). It's still got a TON of work, but I'm having so much fun playing with it so far!

Big thanks to [a super cool] **Kat** for writing this [Medium post](https://medium.com/@katfukui/the-design-portfolio-workflow-a94030d0b39e#.s4t4e7btd) about putting together a portfolio site in Jekyll.

## To-Dos

- Reduce line width for better readability
 - Explore different layouts of images and text to find a balance
- **BACK button**
- Optimize all images for web
- CSS
 - Revisit button style(s)
 - Reconsider header font (sans serif)
 - Clean up CSS files
